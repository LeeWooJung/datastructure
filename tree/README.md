:full_moon: Implementation of Tree Structure

---------

**ðŸ“¦src**  
 â”— **ðŸ“‚treeStructure**  : package of tree structure.  
 â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“‚Node** : package of node.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œBinaryNode.java** : Implementation of Binary Tree's node. This node can have information of parent node, its depth, location(index) of the array that represent tree structure.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œBSTNode.java** : Implementation of Binary Search Tree's node. This node can have information of parent node, its depth, location(index) of the array that represent tree structure.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— **ðŸ“œNode.java** : Implementation of Simple Tree's node. This node may have many children and have information of its depth.  
 â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“‚Tree** : package of tree.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œBinarySearchTree.java** : Implementation of Binary Search Tree. This class have many methods like "add", "remove", "contain", "resize", "removeNode", "resetProperty", "findPredecessor", "search", "inOrder", "preOrder", "postOrder", "toString", etc.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œBinaryTree.java** : Implementation of Binary Tree. This class have many methods like "addRoot", "add", "remove(when node has degree 0 or 1)", "isFullBinaryTree", "isCompleteBinaryTree", "isPerfectBinaryTree", "isBalancedBinaryTree", etc.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œSimpleTree.java** : Implementation of Simple Tree. This class have uncomplicated methods like "add", "isEmpty", "size", etc.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ **ðŸ“œBST.java** : This is the interface of Binary Search Tree.  
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— **ðŸ“œtree.java** : This is the interface of tree.  
 â”ƒ â”— **ðŸ“œMain.java** : Use Binary Search Tree class to watch how it works.
